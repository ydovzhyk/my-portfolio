  description: `I’m a Full Stack Developer focused on building reliable, scalable, and user-centric web applications.

My main stack includes React, Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB. I also work with Vue.js, Firebase, and TypeScript — always looking to expand my toolkit and learn something new.

What drives me is turning ideas into clean, effective solutions that make a real difference. I enjoy solving technical challenges and crafting products that people enjoy using.

If you're looking for someone who takes ownership, thinks critically, and codes with purpose — let’s connect and build something meaningful.`,
